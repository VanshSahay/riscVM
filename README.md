# A Beginner's Guide to zkVMs — built with riscVM

This repo is a working, from-scratch zkVM (zero-knowledge virtual machine) written in Go. It runs real RISC-V programs and can cryptographically prove that each instruction was executed correctly — without revealing the execution trace itself.

If you've heard the words "zkVM", "ZK rollup", or "validity proof" and wanted to understand what they actually mean, this codebase is designed to show you, piece by piece.

---

## What problem does a zkVM solve?

Imagine you run a computation — say, a Fibonacci function that runs for a million steps — and you get an answer. Now imagine you want to convince someone else that your answer is correct, without making them re-run the entire computation themselves.

Traditionally you'd have to share all your work: every step, every intermediate value. The other person checks it all. This is slow and defeats the point of offloading computation.

A **zkVM** gives you a better deal: you run the program, and at the end you produce a short **proof** — a few hundred bytes — that cryptographically guarantees your answer is correct. The verifier checks only the proof (milliseconds of work), not the execution. This is the core idea behind ZK rollups, zkEVMs, and verifiable compute.

## The three layers every zkVM has

Every zkVM — from simple demos like this one to production systems like SP1, Risc Zero, or zkSync's ZKEVM — is built from the same three conceptual layers:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  1. Execution Engine                        │
│     Runs the program. Produces a trace.     │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  2. Arithmetization                         │
│     Turns the trace into math constraints.  │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  3. Proving System                          │
│     Proves the constraints are satisfied    │
│     without revealing the trace itself.     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

This repo implements all three. Let's walk through each one.

---

## Layer 1: The Execution Engine (`vm/`)

The VM is a RISC-V RV32I emulator. RISC-V is a real, open CPU instruction set with 47 base instructions. Programs compiled for RISC-V run here.

The **fetch-decode-execute cycle** is the heartbeat of any CPU:

```
┌──────────┐    ┌──────────┐    ┌──────────┐
│  Fetch   │───▶│  Decode  │───▶│ Execute  │
│          │    │          │    │          │
│ Read the │    │ Figure   │    │ Update   │
│ next     │    │ out what │    │ registers│
│ 32-bit   │    │ the bits │    │ and PC   │
│ instr    │    │ mean     │    │          │
└──────────┘    └──────────┘    └──────────┘
        ▲                              │
        └──────────────────────────────┘
                  (repeat)
```

The CPU state at any point is just:
- **PC** — the program counter (which instruction to fetch next)
- **32 registers** — `x0` through `x31` (x0 is always 0)
- **16 MB of memory**

Every instruction takes a "before" state and produces an "after" state. This is the key insight for ZK: each step is a deterministic state transition, which means it can be expressed as a mathematical constraint.

The emulator also captures a **trace** — a log of every step's before/after register values and memory accesses. This trace is the raw input to the ZK layer.

Key files:
- `vm/cpu.go` — the Step loop and syscall handler
- `vm/decode.go` — bitfield extraction for all instruction formats (R/I/S/B/U/J types)
- `vm/instruction.go` — Execute() implementations for all 47 instructions
- `vm/memory.go` — byte-addressable memory with OOB error reporting
- `vm/trace.go` — the execution trace data structure

---

## Layer 2: Arithmetization (`zk/circuit.go`)

This is where the magic happens, and also where most zkVM tutorials lose people. Let's go slow.

### What is a "constraint"?

A constraint is just an equation that must hold. For example:

```
result = left + right
```

If you can show that all your constraints are satisfied, you've proven the computation is correct.

The ZK proof system works over a **finite field** (in this project, BN254). Every value — register contents, PC, instruction bits — is treated as a number in this field. Constraints become polynomial equations.

### What is R1CS?

This project uses **Rank-1 Constraint Systems (R1CS)** via the [gnark](https://github.com/ConsenSys/gnark) library. An R1CS constraint looks like:

```
(a · x) * (b · y) = (c · z)
```

The clever part: you can express any computation as a collection of these. Addition is free; multiplication costs one constraint.

### How one RISC-V step becomes constraints

For each instruction step, the circuit (`zk/circuit.go`) must prove:

1. **Instruction decoding is correct** — the opcode, rd, rs1, rs2, funct3, funct7 fields all match the raw 32-bit instruction word (enforced by bit decomposition constraints).

2. **The immediate value is honest** — the Imm field is reconstructed inside the circuit from the raw Instr bits according to the instruction format (I/S/B/J/U-type). A prover cannot supply a fake Imm and have the circuit accept it.

3. **The register result is correct** — for an ADD instruction, `RegsAfter[rd] == RegsBefore[rs1] + RegsBefore[rs2]`. For a shift, the barrel-shifter constraints fire. For a comparison, a 33-bit subtraction captures the borrow/sign bit.

4. **The right register was written** — a multiplexer checks that only `RegsAfter[rd]` changed; all other registers must equal their before values.

5. **The PC advanced correctly** — whether by 4 (sequential), by a branch offset (if the branch condition holds), or to a jump target.

Here is what a single ADD step looks like as a constraint, conceptually:

```
RegsBefore[rs1] + RegsBefore[rs2] == RegsAfter[rd]   (if opcode is ADD)
RegsAfter[i] == RegsBefore[i]                         (for all i ≠ rd)
PCAfter == PCBefore + 4                               (no branch)
```

The circuit enforcese all of these simultaneously for every possible instruction, using boolean selectors (`IsAdd`, `IsSub`, `isBranch`, etc.) multiplied against the relevant result.

### Key concept: one circuit, all instructions

The circuit doesn't branch for different opcodes — it **computes all possible outcomes** and then selects the right one using multiplexers. This is required because ZK circuits are static; they have no "if/else" at the circuit level, only linear combinations and products.

```
targetVal = IsAdd * resAdd
          + IsSub * resSub  
          + IsAnd * resAnd
          + IsAddi * resAddi
          + ...
```

Because exactly one selector is 1 and the rest are 0, only one term survives.

## Layer 3: The Proving System

### What proof system is used?

gnark supports two backends, both used in tests:
- **Groth16** — a pairing-based SNARK. Very short proofs (~200 bytes), fast verification, but requires a per-circuit trusted setup.
- **PLONK** — a universal SNARK. No per-circuit setup needed (uses a universal SRS), slightly larger proofs.

Both operate over the **BN254 elliptic curve** (also called alt_bn128), the same curve used by Ethereum's precompiles — which is why Groth16 proofs can be verified on-chain cheaply.

### The workflow

```

         ▼
   Compile to R1CS
         │
         ▼

         │                         │                │
         ▼                         ▼                ▼
  Witness (prover fills      groth16.Prove()   groth16.Verify()
  in concrete values)             │                │
                                  ▼                ▼
                               Proof ─────────► true / false
```

In this repo, the gnark `test` harness runs the full prove/verify cycle automatically in `zk/zk_test.go`. The WASM dashboard calls the real Groth16 prover on every step — `ProveStep` compiles the circuit once, runs `groth16.Setup` once (cached via `sync.Once`), then calls `groth16.Prove` and `groth16.Verify` for each instruction. The "Proof Verified" badge in the dashboard reflects a genuine cryptographic proof.

---

## What the tests prove

The ZK test suite (`zk/zk_test.go`) exercises the full gnark prove/verify pipeline:

- **ADD x3, x1, x2** with `x1=10, x2=20` → expects `x3=30, PC+=4`
- **SUB x4, x3, x1** with `x3=30, x1=10` → expects `x4=20, PC+=4`
- **ADDI x5, x1, 5** with `x1=10` → expects `x5=15, PC+=4`
- **BEQ x1, x2, +8** — tested for both taken (`x1==x2`, PC jumps) and not-taken (`x1!=x2`, PC advances normally)
- **LUI x6, 0x12345** → expects `x6=0x12345000, PC+=4`
- **JALR x7, x1, 4** with `x1=100` → expects `x7=PC+4, PCAfter=104`
- **FENCE** — treated as a no-op; all registers unchanged, PC advances by 4

All cases are checked under the BN254 curve. If you supply a wrong witness (e.g. lie about the result), gnark rejects it.

---

## What to implement next

Here are concrete next steps, roughly in order of difficulty:

### Intermediate

**4. Memory constraints (the hard one)**
Currently the circuit does not constrain loads and stores — it only constrains register state. A real zkVM must prove that every memory read is consistent with a previous write. The standard technique is a **memory permutation argument**: sort all (address, timestamp, value) memory access tuples and prove with a grand-product check that no value was forged. This is what PLOOKUP, Halo2's lookup tables, and similar systems are designed for.

**5. Multi-step trace proof**
Right now each step is proved in isolation. To prove program correctness you need to chain steps: the `PCAfter` and `RegsAfter` of step N become the `PCBefore` and `RegsBefore` of step N+1. This can be done by:
- Hashing the full state at each step and chaining the hashes (simple but expensive)
- Using **recursive SNARKs**: each step proof is itself verified inside the next step's circuit (what Risc Zero does)

**6. Compressed witness representation**
The current witness sends all 32 registers for every step. In practice, most instructions touch at most 3 registers. Use a sparse representation and constraint that untouched registers carry over unchanged.

### Advanced

**7. Recursive proof aggregation**
Instead of proving N steps separately, use gnark's `std/recursion` package to recursively aggregate them: prove that a Groth16 proof is valid inside another Groth16 circuit. This compresses N proofs into 1 constant-size proof regardless of program length.

**8. On-chain verifier**
Export the Groth16 verification key and generate a Solidity verifier with `gnark`'s `backend/groth16/bn254/solidity` exporter. Deploy it and submit your proof transaction — the EVM will verify it for ~250k gas.

**9. RV32IM extension**
Add the M extension: MUL, MULH, MULHU, MULHSU, DIV, DIVU, REM, REMU. Multiplication in a ZK circuit is expensive (each bit of the product needs a constraint), so this is where circuit optimization starts to matter.

**10. Continuations / segmented proving**
Programs longer than ~100k steps become impractical to prove in one shot (memory and time). Split execution into fixed-size **segments**, prove each segment separately, then prove that segments stitch together (matching boundary state). This is how SP1 and Risc Zero handle arbitrary-length programs.
